This is my collection of dot/rc files, mostly zshrc but with a few other
tidbits. It's intended for personal use but since I copied 95% from elsewhere
you should feel free to copy it from me. :)

For convenience, the dot-files are not dotted here. Run ./install to copy
them into your home directory as dot-files. It should theoretically make a
backup of what you have there already. But of course:

THESE FILES COME WITH NO WARRANTY AND YOU USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.
